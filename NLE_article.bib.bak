	(MLAN) to incorporate out-of-domain data when training large vocabulary
	speech recognition systems. In a set of experiments on multi-genre
	broadcast data and on TED lecture recordings we present results using
	of out-of-domain features in a hybrid DNN system and explore tandem
	systems using a variety of input acoustic features. Our experiments
	indicate using the MLAN approach in both hybrid and tandem systems
	results in consistent reductions in word error rate of 5--10\% relative.},
